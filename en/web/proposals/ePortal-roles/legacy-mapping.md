- The original legacy group name and codes
- The new role(s) required to replicate access
- Any applied restrictions (like `No Pricing`)
- Notes about special handling or overrides

## `(US) TCI - [O-WNG] [S-NG] [A] [W]` {: #us-tci }

**Mapped Roles:**
- `Order – WH Order Submission`
- `Status – Gov't & Bus`
- `Status – National Account`
- `Status – Invoice`
- `Warranty – Create Warranty`

**Pricing Restrictions:**
- ❌ None explicitly marked; pricing assumed available where roles grant it

**Notes:**
- Pricing privileges like `U` come from specific roles (e.g., WH Order Submission)  
- No `[SH-N]` or `[P]` codes present, so default behavior applies

---

## `All Permissions & No Price - [O] [S] [A] [R] [W]` {: #all-permissions-no-price }

**Mapped Roles:**
- `All Permissions`  
- `No Pricing`

**Pricing Restrictions:**
- ✅ Fully removed via `No Pricing` role

**Notes:**
- Full access without pricing — designed for view-only or non-commercial users  
- `No Pricing` removes all `U` and `L` privileges granted by `All Permissions`

---

## `Car Dealer & Secondary Supply & National Account & Warranty` {: #car-dealer-secondary-supply-national-account-warranty }

**Mapped Roles:**
- `Order – Car Dealer Order`
- `Order – Secondary Supply Submission`
- `National Account – Fleet Create a New Delivery Receipt`
- `Warranty – Create Warranty`

**Pricing Restrictions:**
- ❌ None; pricing retained where roles include it

**Notes:**
- Covers broad dealer functionality with full privilege set  
- No indicators suggest pricing needs to be restricted

---

## `Order Submission & National Account & Sales Report` {: #order-submission-national-account-sales-report }

**Mapped Roles:**
- `Order – WH Order Submission`
- `National Account – Fleet Create a New Delivery Receipt`
- `Report – Sales Report`

**Pricing Restrictions:**
- ❌ None; pricing retained where roles include it

**Notes:**
- Sales Report includes `A` and `S` only — does not grant `U` or `L`  
- `Order – WH Order Submission` includes `U`, so pricing is available unless restricted

---

## `(US) Carroll Tire - [P-U] [O-SCDNG] [S-SCDNG] [W]` {: #us-carroll-tire }

**Mapped Roles:**
- `Order – Secondary Supply Submission`
- `Order – Car Dealer Order`
- `Order – DFC Order`
- `Status – Secondary Supply`
- `Status – Car Dealer`
- `Status – DFC`
- `Warranty – Create Warranty`

**Pricing Restrictions:**
- ✅ Unit Price only (`[P-U]`)  
- ❌ List Price is not granted

**Notes:**
- Legacy group was designed to give partial pricing access (unit only)  
- If reuse is frequent, consider making a custom role like `Order – WH + Unit Price Only`
