# 🧩 Direct Privilege Grants

This document explains how to apply individual permission and privilege overrides directly to a user, outside of their assigned roles.

Direct grants should be used sparingly — only when roles and filters (like `No Pricing`) are insufficient.

## When to Use Direct Grants {: #when-to-use-direct-grants }

Use a direct grant when:

- A user needs **just one extra permission or privilege**
- You need to **override a `No Pricing` role** for a specific case
- A legacy group had an uncommon combination not worth turning into a reusable role

---

## How Direct Grants Work {: #how-direct-grants-work }

Direct grants are stored per user, alongside (but separate from) their roles. They allow you to:

- Add or override specific privileges (`A`, `S`, `U`, `L`) for a given permission
- Either supplement or override inherited role-based permissions

They are evaluated **after roles and filters** like `No Pricing`.

---

## Examples {: #examples }

### ✅ Example 1: Add Unit Price for Sales Report only

User roles:
- `Report – Sales Report` (grants `A`, `S`)
- `No Pricing` (removes `U`, `L`)

→ Add direct grant:

```text
User: jdoe  
Permission: Report → Sales Report  
Privileges: U
```

Now the user has:
- `A`, `S` from role
- `U` from direct grant
- `L` still removed via `No Pricing`

---

### ✅ Example 2: Custom invoice access

User doesn't need `Invoice` role, just wants to view stock-level invoice data.

→ Add direct grant:

```text
User: jsmith  
Permission: Status → Invoice  
Privileges: A, S
```

---

## Best Practices {: #best-practices }

- ✅ Use direct grants only for **rare exceptions**
- ❌ Do not replace roles with direct grants
- 🔐 Always log and review direct grants regularly
- 🔄 Prefer to update roles or create small custom roles if multiple users need the same override
