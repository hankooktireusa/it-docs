# 🚫 No Pricing Rules

This page documents when and how to apply the `No Pricing` role to users in the new RBAC model. The `No Pricing` role removes all privileges related to pricing visibility:

- `U` = Unit Price
- `L` = List Price

## When to Apply `No Pricing`

Assign the `No Pricing` role **only when the legacy group includes** the `[SH-N]` tag.

Examples of legacy groups that should receive `No Pricing`:
- `[SH-N] Order + SSP`
- `[SH-N] Gov + Warranty`
- `[SH-N] Order All + NA All + Warranty`

These groups were explicitly restricted from viewing pricing data in the legacy system.

---

## How It Works

The `No Pricing` role:
- Does **not** grant any new permissions on its own
- Acts as a filter that removes any `U` or `L` privileges granted by other roles

It supports the **Principle of Least Privilege** by ensuring users can't access pricing data unless explicitly allowed.

### Example:
A user has:
- `Order – WH Order Submission` (includes `U`)
- `Report – Sales Report` (includes `S`)
- `No Pricing`

→ The result is:
- `A`, `S` are kept
- `U` (Unit Price) from Order role is removed

---

## When Not to Apply `No Pricing`

Do **not** apply the `No Pricing` role when the legacy group includes:
- `[P]` → Pricing access in general
- `[P-U]` → Unit Price
- `[P-L]` → List Price

If neither `[SH-N]` nor `[P-*]` is present, assume the default privileges from the assigned roles apply.

---

## Edge Cases & Overrides

If a user:
- Is assigned `No Pricing`, but
- Needs pricing access for a **specific permission** (e.g., `Unit Price` for `Sales Report`),

You can either:
1. **Add a specific override role** (e.g., `Sales Report – Unit Price Only`)
2. Use a direct user-level override if your system supports it (e.g., via `user_permissions`)
