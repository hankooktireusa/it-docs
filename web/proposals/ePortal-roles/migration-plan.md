# 🔄 Role Onboarding Plan: New RBAC Implementation

This plan outlines how to roll out the new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for a new platform. The new structure preserves the same access patterns users had in legacy systems, but delivers them through a cleaner, more standardized, and more maintainable model.

## 📌 Phase 1: Access Pattern Analysis

> Goal: Identify required access patterns and permission sets for all user types on the new site.

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Define user personas and business functions**
2. **List all required permissions and associated privilege levels**
3. **Map common combinations to potential roles**
4. **Document special or restricted scenarios (e.g., no pricing)**

---

## 📌 Phase 2: Role Design Finalization

> Goal: Build a clean set of roles in `role-definitions.md` that reflect all standard access needs.

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Define base roles for each key function (e.g., Order Submitter, Fleet Viewer)**
2. **Incorporate scoping logic (e.g., region, segment) where needed**
3. **Add modifier roles like `No Pricing` or `Report Only`**
4. **Ensure role coverage meets all documented access needs**

---

## 📌 Phase 3: Initial User Role Assignment

> Goal: Assign users to roles based on their expected use cases for the new platform.

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Assign one or more roles per user based on persona**
2. **Use scoped roles where applicable (e.g., Fleet CA only)**
3. **Apply restrictive roles as needed (e.g., `No Pricing`)**
4. **Document any direct overrides used for edge cases**

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Testing & Verification

> Goal: Ensure all roles provide intended access and restrictions work correctly.

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Test all base roles against sample users**
2. **Verify scoping behavior in different contexts**
3. **Check behavior of restrictive roles (`No Pricing`, etc.)**
4. **Log and address any unexpected access gaps or overreach**

---

## 📌 Phase 5: Production Deployment

> Goal: Launch the RBAC system on the new platform with clean tracking and observability.

### ✅ Steps:
1. **Enable role-based access enforcement in the new site**
2. **Monitor activity and behavior across user types**
3. **Track and resolve feedback or edge case access issues**
4. **Plan periodic access reviews to validate assignments**

## 🧩 Notes

- This RBAC model supports the same level of access users had in legacy systems, but with a **more structured, maintainable, and transparent approach**.
- The `All Permissions` role can be used for administrative or all-access needs.
- Restrictive roles (e.g., `No Pricing`) provide global access controls.
- Direct privilege overrides are supported but should be used sparingly and logged.
